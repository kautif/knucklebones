<h2>What is Knucklebones?</h2>
<p>Knucklebones is a minigame in Cult of the Lamb. It was also a game before Cult of the Lamb, but playing Cult of Lamb is how I came to know about it. It's a 2 player game. Each player has a 3x3 grid. Each player drops dice in one of 3 columns. Each die occupies the highest most row of the selected column. And, one's score increases based off of the value of the die added. One's score can also be reduced or multiplied. More can be read about this on the rules page.</p>

<h2>Future Features I Could Work On</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Update mobile diceboard grids to read horizontally instead of vertically and flip positioning (Completed) </li>
    <li>Add sounds for dice, cats, winner, and music</li>
    <li>Add option to play against CPU (i.e. dropping dice automatically based on some simple rules)</li>
</ul>
